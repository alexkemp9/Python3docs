70 Chapter 2. Data Types

If we use the second (one colon) syntax, we can omit either of the integer
indexes. If we omit the start index, it will default to 0. If we omit the end index,
it will default to len(seq). This means that if we omit both indexes, for example,
s[:], it is the same as writing s[0:len(s)], and extracts—that is, copies—the
entire sequence.

Given the assignment s = "The waxwork man", Figure 2.2 shows some example
slices for string s.

Figure 2.2 Sequence slicing

One way of inserting a substring inside a string is to mix slicing with concate-
nation. For example:

>>> s = s[:12] + "wo" + s[12:]
>>> Ss
“The waxwork woman’

In fact, since the text “wo” appears in the original string, we could have
achieved the same effect by assigning s[:12] + s[7:9] + s[12:].

Using + to concatenate and += to append is not particularly efficient when
many strings are involved. For joining lots of strings it is usually best to use
the str.join() method, as we will see in the next subsection.

The third (two colon) slice syntax is like the second, only instead of extracting
every character, every step-th character is taken. And like the second syntax,
we can omit either of the index integers. If we omit the start index, it will
default to 0—unless a negative step is given, in which case the start index
defaults to -1. If we omit the end index, it will default to len(seq)—unless a
negative step is given, in which case the end index effectively defaults to before
the beginning of the string. If we use two colons but omit the step size, it will
default to 1. But there is no point using the two colon syntax with a step size
of 1, since that’s the default anyway. Also, a step size of zero isn’t allowed.

If we have the assignment s = "he ate camel food", Figure 2.3 shows a couple of
example strided slices for string s.

Here we have used the default start and end indexes, so s[::-2] starts at the
last character and extracts every second character counting toward the start
of the string. Similarly, s[::3] starts at the first character and extracts every
third character counting toward the end.
