and which in turn has a list of new rows and child blocks (including empty

blocks) inside the “Frame”. This is illustrated in Figure 14.14—the message-
box. blk file was shown earlier (526 <).

All the blocks parsers shown in this chapter return a root block with child
blocks as Figures 14.13 and 14.14 illustrate—providing the parse is successful.
The BlockOutput . py module that the blocks. py program uses provides a function
called save_blocks_as_svg() that takes a root block and traverses its children
recursively to create an SVG file to visually represent the blocks.

Figure 14.14 The parsed messagebox. blk file’s blocks and their children

Before creating the parser, we will begin by defining a Block class to representa
block and any child blocks it contains. Then we will look at the parser, and see

how it produces a single root Block whose child blocks represent the contents
of the . blk file it parses.

Instances of the Block class have three attributes: name, color, and children (a
possibly empty list of children). A root block has no name or color,and an empty
