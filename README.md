Caution!

"3_new.odt" currently causes the entire OS in my desktop computer to freeze, which then requires system restart. You have been warned.

These files are here to enable research & a bughunt to discover the reason for that system freeze.

All these files have only just been uploaded late at night & this README will be updated in the morning.
